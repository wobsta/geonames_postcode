description = "geonames_postcode is a Python package to make geonames.org postcode databases accessible in Python. It provides a command line tool to fetch, preprocess, and store the data in a Python file per country. In the result very fast (in-memory) queries by postcodes and names are available using just a few MB per country. Some helper functions are part of the package to solve common tasks like getting distances and finding postcodes nearby."
